# BookSearch

## Description 

In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Usage 

You can clone or fork this application from Gihtub to access on your local machine or visit the deployed app at https://infinite-ocean-88088.herokuapp.com/ 

## Credits 

I worked with my tutor on this homework.
